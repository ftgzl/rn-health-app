            Masks are an additional step to help prevent people from getting and
            spreading COVID-19. They provide a barrier that keeps respiratory
            droplets from spreading. Wear a mask and take every day preventive
            actions in public settings.

          <Text>
            Store your cloth mask properly and wash it regularly to keep it
            clean. Consider having more than one mask on hand so that you can
            easily replace a dirty mask with a clean one. Make sure to remove
            your mask correctly and wash your hands after touching a used mask.

            Two important ways to make sure your mask works the best it can
          </Text>
          <Text>
            - Make sure your mask fits snugly against your face. Gaps can let
            air with respiratory droplets leak in and out around the edges of
            the mask
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Pick a mask with layers to keep your respiratory droplets in and
            othersâ€™ out. A mask with layers will stop more respiratory droplets
            getting inside your mask or escaping from your mask if you are sick.
